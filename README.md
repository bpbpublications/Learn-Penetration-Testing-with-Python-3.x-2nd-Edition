## About the Book
This book starts with an understanding of penetration testing and red teaming methodologies, and teaches Python 3 from scratch for those who are not familiar with programming. The book also guides on how to create scripts for cracking and brute force attacks. 

The second part of this book will focus on network and wireless level. The book will teach you the skills to create an offensive tool using Python 3 to identify different services and ports. You will learn how to use different Python network modules and conduct network attacks. In the network monitoring section, you will be able to monitor layer 3 and 4. Finally, you will be able to conduct different wireless attacks. The third part of this book will focus on web applications and exploitation developments. It will start with how to create scripts to extract web information, such as links, images, documents etc. We will then move to creating scripts for identifying and exploiting web vulnerabilities and how to bypass web application firewall. It will move to a more advanced level to create custom Burp Suite extensions that will assist you in web application assessments.

This edition brings chapters that will be using Python 3 in forensics and analyze different file extensions. The next chapters will focus on fuzzing and exploitation development, starting with how to play with stack, moving to how to use Python in fuzzing, and creating exploitation scripts. Finally, it will give a guide on how to use ChatGPT to create and enhance your Python 3 scripts.
